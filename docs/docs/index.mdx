# React Native Skia List

React Native Skia List is a high-performance list component for React Native. \
It is built on top of [Skia](https://skia.org/), a powerful 2D graphics library, and is designed to be very fast and efficient.

It does not have a layout engine and you, the library user, are responsible for calculating the layout of list items. \
This makes it harder to use than other list libraries, but also makes it very performant and customizable.

You can achieve good looking, interactive and high-performance lists with a lot of items like the following example:

<video
  className="max-w-72 w-[100vw] rounded-sm mb-5"
  controls
  loop
  muted
  autoPlay
  playsinline
>
  <source src="/demo.mov" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p className="!mb-1">
  See the following scroll performance comparison between Skia List and [Flash
  List](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/):

<div className="text-sm font-bold mb-5">
